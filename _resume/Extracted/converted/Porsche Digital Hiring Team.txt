Porsche Digital Hiring Team,

Please accept my attached resume for your posting on the open UX Researcher/Developer position. 

Website Design and Development is my JAM, and creating a universally accessible user experience, while maintaining solid development functionality and security, have always been at the forefront of my craft.  Unfortunately, things have been quite tricky, in the world of client contracts, due to COVID-19, which is why I'm looking for my next role. Fortunately, opportunities like this, when we make the most of them, are where we find the kind of change we truly need. 

That said, I've been in development for just over ten years now, and have traversed most of the development and design landscape. I'm looking for a role with your company because I think a Porsche role would be a fantastic place to land; your team seems to understand and appreciate the need for balanced craftsmen (and hopefully crafts-women) in both form and function, and I love your cars to boot. (But, then again, who doesn't)

Yes, I have the skillset for this role, and the value that I bring as a more eclectic engineer, along-side the added benefit of difference that we have within your international team, will undoubtedly help me grow professionally and personally. 

If you like what you see, I would strongly recommend you schedule something with me on my calendar via https://calendly.com/batmanwgd; that way, you can get right to the 1st call, and we can get this ball rolling ASAP. :)

Üdvözlettel,
Kaska
