    <p>Due to the propensity of <em>automated consumption</em> in resume review these days, Kaska has elected to provide two copies of her resume. The first, <a href="/assets/pdfs/Resume-Kaska-Miskolczi.pdf" class="mag">tailored to human readers</a>, and the second, <a href="/assets/pdfs/KaskaMiskolczi_Branded-OCR.pdf" class="mag">tailored to these SAAS platforms.</a></p><br>

    <p><em>Stay tuned for the edition Kaska is currently working on, tailored to the computers, with one written in ASM and another in JSON.</em></p><br><br>
